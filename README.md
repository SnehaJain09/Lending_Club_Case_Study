This project is to help the company understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators 
of default.The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
For lending companies, lending loans to risky applicants is the largest source of financial loss.

In such a case, the concerned person is labelled as charged-of and defaulters.If one is able to identify such risky applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using Exploratory data analysis from the given attributes in the data is the primary objective of this case study.
